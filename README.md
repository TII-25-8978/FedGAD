# FedGAD
Divergence-Regularized Federated GANs for Effective Cyber Attack Detection on Non-IID and Unlabeled Edge Activity Data

Federated Generative Adversarial Divergence (FedGAD) is a plug-and-play modular framework that enhances existing federated learning methods through Jacobian-based regularization and dynamic complexity-aware weighting to address cyber attack detection in non-IID and unlabeled edge data environments.
